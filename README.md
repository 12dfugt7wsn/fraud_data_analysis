# fraud_data_analysis
This is an analytical project on fraud data. I'm trying to predict the fraud behaviors in online shopping based on given datasets which include browser, purchase time, location of the users etc.  
There are two parts of the project done in two semesters, the first part is in "Fraud_data" and the second part is in “Fraud_data_part2”. The goal of the two parts are the same but part2 includes more detailed exploration on the project after finishing part1.   
The first part of the project is about building basic linear models using R  
The second part of the project focuses more on feature engineering such as creating new dummy variables and new explanatory variables to predict frauds.
